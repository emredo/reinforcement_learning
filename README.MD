# Actor Critic Methods in Reinforcement Learning

<section><p>
As you know there are many approaches about reinforcement 
learning. This repository aims 'actor critic' methods and
'policy optimization techniques'. In first commit, the Proximal Policy
Optimization gradient method was applied to agent with actor critic method.
</p>

<p>
Without PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) agent also be uploaded. Continuous 
Lunar Landing task is a bit complex, so application of PPO made this task easier.

### What happens without PPO?
<section><p>
This update will be uploaded soon, but it requires widely more epochs than 
PPO applied method. I'm working on it.
